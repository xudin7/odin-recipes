    <p>
      Fried chicken, also called Southern fried chicken, is a dish consisting of
      chicken pieces that have been coated with seasoned flour or batter and
      pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried. The breading adds a
      crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining
      juices in the meat. Broiler chickens are most commonly used. The first
      dish known to have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the
      European Middle Ages.
