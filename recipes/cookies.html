    <p>
      A cookie or biscuit is a baked snack or dessert that is typically small,
      flat, and sweet. It usually contains flour, sugar, egg, and some type of
      oil, fat, or butter. It may include other ingredients such as raisins,
      oats, chocolate chips, or nuts. Cookie texture varies from crisp and
      crunchy to soft and chewy, depending on the exact combination of
      ingredients and methods used to create them. Most English-speaking
      countries call crunchy cookies "biscuits", except for the United States
      and sometimes in Canada, where "biscuit" refers to a type of quick bread.
