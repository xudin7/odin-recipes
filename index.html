      A recipe is a set of instructions that describes how to prepare or make
      something, especially a dish of prepared food. A sub-recipe or subrecipe
      is a recipe for an ingredient that will be called for in the instructions
      for the main recipe. Recipe books are a collection of recipes, help
      reflect cultural identities and social changes as well as serve as
      educational tools.
